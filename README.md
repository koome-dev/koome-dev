- 👀 I’m a Geospatial Engineer with data science skills so I guess you can call me a Geospatial Data Scientist
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring projects that combine geospatial knowledge with data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Python, Geospatial Analysis, Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects
